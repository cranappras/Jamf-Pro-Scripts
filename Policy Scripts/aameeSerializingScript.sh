# ABOUT THIS PROGRAM
#
# NAME
#	aameeSerializingScript.sh
#
# SYNOPSIS - How to use
#
# A - Build the Composer Package
# 1) Use the Adobe Application Manager Enterprise Edition to create a â€œSerialization File" 
# 2) Use Composer.app to create a package for the two files created in step 1. Example:
#     /tmp/CS6_DWP/AdobeSerialization
#     /tmp/CS6_DWP/prov.xml
# 2a) Set ownership/permissions of these two files to root:admin, 755
# 3) Build Composer Source as DMG, upload to Casper Suite.
#
# B - Use the Script and Policy
# 1) Upload this script to the JSS, and set the following details in the script metadata:
#      - run "After" 
#      - $4 parameter = AdobeSerializationPath 
#      - $5 parameter = provXmlPath
# 2) Add the package and script into a policy 
# 3) Match the $4 and $5 parameters with the full absolute file paths of the two files from the package built in Composer above.
